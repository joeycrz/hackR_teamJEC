Hello, this is the UT Health Center. How may I help you?
Hi, I'd like to schedule an appointment to see a physician.
And what would this appointment be for?
Risk pain.
Risk pain. We have an opening tomorrow at the 2pm
over in Edinburgh at the RGV Health Center. Will that work?
I'm located in Bronzeville. Can I just get an appointment there?
Oh yeah, let me check our availability.
We have an appointment for 11am, there's a slot for 2pm
and then another for 2.30pm and 4pm.
Do those times tomorrow work for you?
No, can I have one for now? I need it today.
We are booked for today.
We can call in and see if there might be a way to squeeze you in
but most likely we won't be able to.
You'll have to wait.
If it needs to be seen today and you feel like it's an emergency
then we do advise that you seek an urgent care center
or you could go and call now.
But why can't I just go there?
Why do I have to call 9-1-1?
You don't have to call 9-1-1 but you could go to the urgent care center.
The reason that we might not be able to see you today
is just due to physician availability
and usually risk pain is not going to be an emer-
I can't say that.
It may not be an emergent reason to be seen.
Okay then, tomorrow for 2pm.
Alright, we'll put you down there. Thank you.
