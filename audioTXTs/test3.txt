Hi! This is the OB-GYN clinic on Jackson Road. We are calling about a Jamie Foxx who is scheduled to have a hysterectomy tomorrow.
We want to confirm that you will be covering this procedure.
Yeah, could you give me his policy number and the date of birth and last four digits of social security?
Yeah, date of birth is 10-6-19-97. Policy number is GMPX563.
Okay, it seems like he will not be covered due to our policy, unfortunately.
And can you tell me why you are denying coverage?
Because it's an exceeded amount. He's had too many surgeries prior and so we only have a cap, a yearly cap.
Okay, I will let the doctor know. Thank you.
Alright, buh-bye.
